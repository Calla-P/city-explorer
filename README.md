# City Explorer

**Author**: Paula Davidson
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview

This application is to let the users search a city and see it on a map. When the users inputs the city it should display the latitude and longitude as well as have the location displayed on a map. It should also display a wheather forecast for a couple of days.

## Getting Started

1. Procure a LocationIQ free-tier account. From the Dashboard, navigate to your API Access Tokens page. View, then Update the existing token, to change the label to "City Explorer".
2. MOST IMPORTANTLY: Add your deployed Netlify app url as an HTTP Referrer to your API token settings. This step is necessary to prevent any unauthorized use of your token. Also add localhost while testing from your development environment.
3. Create an .env file: Your API key goes here for local development. Make sure this file is in your .gitignore.
4. Add your API key to your Netlify deployment. Under "Site settings" > "Build & deploy" > "Environment", you need to add "Edit variables" to add your API key, giving it the same name you used in your local .env file.
5. In the visual studio code npm istall, build, and start coding. 

## Architecture

City- Explorer will use CSS, HTML5, Bootstrap, React, and JavaScript.
